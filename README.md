# üß† English-to-Spanish Text Translator

This project is a **text-to-text machine translation system** that translates English sentences to Spanish using an **LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture**. It uses **custom SentencePiece tokenizers**, and the model weights are hosted on the Hugging Face Hub. A minimal **Streamlit web interface** is provided for interaction.

## üß† Model Details

- **Architecture**: LSTM encoder-decoder
- **Embedding Size**: 512  
- **Hidden Size**: 1024  
- **Layers**: 5  
- **Tokenization**: SentencePiece (subword units)
- **Training**: Done offline; only inference is supported here

Model weights are downloaded from [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/unbracedm56/lstm_models):

- `lstm_encoder_final_17.pth`
- `lstm_decoder_final_17.pth`
